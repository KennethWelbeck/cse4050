        <p>Git. Create a remote git repository on GitHub. You can make your repository public; but if you make it private, 
            then add me as a collaborator (my GitHub id is csusbdt). Create a Web page with any content you like. Place your code in a file named index.html and add it to your remote repository. Include a link to 
            your remote repository in your next progress report.</p>

        <p>Done.</p>
